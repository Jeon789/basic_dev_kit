Basic kit for Deep Learning Tasks.

Revise this code for your task.

There are still chores need to be changed at main.py.
These things will changed at future.

Preliminary
-------------
Scheduler from "https://github.com/katsura-jp/pytorch-cosine-annealing-with-warmup"

Notification
------------
parser of utils/argument.py is the higher level than config of config.yaml.
